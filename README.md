# Bundler::Multilock

[![Gem Version](https://img.shields.io/gem/v/bundler-multilock)](https://rubygems.org/gems/bundler-multilock)
[![Continous Integration](https://github.com/instructure/bundler-multilock/workflows/Continuous%20Integration/badge.svg)](https://github.com/instructure/bundler-multilock/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

Extends Bundler to allow arbitrarily many lockfiles (and Gemfiles!)
for variations of the Gemfile, while keeping all of the lockfiles in sync.

`bundle install`, `bundle lock`, and `bundle update` will operate only on
the default lockfile (Gemfile.lock), afterwhich all other lockfiles will
be re-created based on this default lockfile. Additional lockfiles can be
based on the same Gemfile, but vary at runtime. You can force a specific
lockfile by setting the `BUNDLE_LOCKFILE` environment variable, or customize
it any way you want by setting `current: true` on one of your lockfiles
in your Gemfile.

Alternately (or in addition!), you can define a lockfile to use a completely
different Gemfile. This will have the effect that common dependencies between
the two Gemfiles will stay locked to the same version in each lockfile.

A lockfile definition can opt in to requiring explicit pinning for
any dependency that exists in that variation, but does not exist in the default
lockfile. This is especially useful if for some reason a given
lockfile will _not_ be committed to version control (such as a variation
that will include private gems).

Finally, `bundle check` will enforce additional checks to compare the final
locked versions of dependencies between the various lockfiles to ensure
they end up the same. This check might be tripped if Gemfile variations
(accidentally!) have conflicting version constraints on a dependency, that
are still self-consistent with that single Gemfile variation.
`bundle install`, `bundle lock`, and `bundle update` will also verify these
additional checks. You can additionally explicitly allow version variations
between explicit dependencies (and their sub-dependencies), for cases where
the lockfile variation is specifically to transition to a new version of
a dependency (like a Rails upgrade).

## Installation

Install the gem and add to the Gemfile by executing:

```bash
bundle plugin install bundler-multilock
```

## Usage

Add additional lockfiles to your Gemfile like so:

```ruby
# frozen_string_literal: true

source "https://rubygems.org"

plugin "bundler-multilock", "~> 1.0"
return unless Plugin.installed?("bundler-multilock")
Plugin.send(:load_plugin, "bundler-multilock")

lockfile "rails-6.1" do
  gem "rails", "~> 6.1"
end

lockfile "rails-7.0" do
  gem "rails", "~> 7.0"
end
```

And then run `bundle install`. This will automatically generate additional
lockfiles: `Gemfile.rails-6.1.lock` and `Gemfile.rails-7.0.lock`.
Note that the default lockfile (`Gemfile.lock`) will not contain any gems
that are in the specific `lockfile` blocks. If you have gems you want in
the default lockfile, but not in other lockfiles, you can define a block
for just that lockfile:

```ruby
lockfile do
  gem "rake"
end
```

When running other commands (such as tests), you select the desired lockfile
with `BUNDLE_LOCKFILE`:

```shell
BUNDLE_LOCKFILE=rails-7.0 bundle exec rspec
```

You can also dynamically select it in your Gemfile, and pass `current: true`
to (exactly one!) `lockfile` method.

In some cases, you may want to essentially disable bundler-multilock's
syncing behavior, while still allowing the Gemfile to select the active
lockfile. For example, if you have gems in the default lockfile that cannot
be installed under a certain Ruby version, but still want to be able to CI
against that Ruby version, you may set it up like this:

```ruby
lockfile active: RUBY_VERSION >= "2.7" do
  gem "debug", "~> 1.9"
end

lockfile "ruby-2.6", active: RUBY_VERSION < "2.7" do
  gem "debug", "~> 1.8.0"
end
```

However, you cannot run a regular `bundle install` while running Ruby 2.6 in
this situation, since simply evaluating the default lockfile's block, even
for checking that the lockfiles are valid, will raise an exception that debug
1.9.0 require Ruby 2.7. You could set `BUNDLE_LOCKFILE=ruby-2.6` to have
bundler-multilock only consider the one lockfile, but then your CI may need
additional logic to _not_ set it for other Ruby versions. Instead, you can
set `BUNDLE_LOCKFILE=active`, which will not override the Gemfile's selection
of which lockfile is active, but still behave as if `BUNDLE_LOCKFILE` is set,
bypassing any other syncing logic and not evaluating the default lockfile in
our example.

## Comparison to Appraisal

[Appraisal](https://github.com/thoughtbot/appraisal) is a gem that might serve
a similar purpose, but with a very different implementation. Appraisal is not
a Bundler plugin, and instead works as a separate utility automatically
generating additional gemfiles, based on the primary gemfile. It has no concern
for lockfiles at all, and any steps to ensure the gemfiles themselves stay in
sync are manual. Bundler::Multilock, in contrast, is not a separate file, does
not generate additional gemfiles, automatically keeps the additional lockfiles
synchronized anytime you run `bundle install` or `bundle update`, and ensures
that all common dependencies stay in sync in the lockfile themselves between
the lockfiles. It also supports relatively orthogonal scenarios, such as
keeping dependencies in lockfiles for multiple gems in sync.

### Upgrading from Appraisal to Bundler::Multilock

First, remove appraisal from your Gemfile or gemspec, then install
Bundler::Multilock as above. Then move the contents of your Appraisals file into
your Gemfile, just below the the newly added lines from Bundler::Multilock.
Change the method from `appraise` to `lockfile`. Assuming you've committed
all of your lockfiles, move them from `gemfiles/*.gemfile.lock` to
`Gemfile.*.lock` next to the main Gemfile. Then run `bundle install` to
ensure everything is happy. Be sure to update any tooling that uses
`BUNDLE_GEMFILE` to use `BUNDLE_LOCKFILE` (with the appropriate changes to its
value), and remove any `appraisal install` steps, since they're now redundant.
Bundler::Multilock doesn't have a separate executable to repeat a command for
each lockfile, so you'll need to handle that yourself if you're using
something like `appraisal bundle exec rspec`.

## Comparison to Bootboot

[Bootboot](https://github.com/Shopify/bootboot) is a similar Bundler plugin
that allows multiple lockfiles. It generally has a much narrower scope than
Bundler::Multilock, though. Bootboot only allows two lockfiles, with a fixed
name for the alternate lockfile, while Bundler::Multilock allows an arbitrary
number with arbitrary names. Bootboots synchronization method for the
alternate lockfile is relatively naive - essentially doing the equivalent
of `bundle update --all` on the other lockfile, instead of propagating only
the updated dependencies they have in common. Bundler::Multilock also has
robust mechanisms to ensure that dependencies don't end up being mismatched
outside of the normal workflow. Bootboot uses the `DEPENDENCIES_NEXT`
environment variable to select the lockfile, while Bundler::Multilock uses
`BUNDLER_LOCKFILE` to select a specific lockfile, as well as allowing the
Gemfile itself to dynamically select a specific lockfile using any means it
would like. Bundler::Multilock also features keeping lockfiles in sync amongst
otherwise unrelated Gemfiles, such as if you have vendored gems in your
repository. One feature that differs significantly is Bootboot supports
varying Ruby versions between lockfiles, and ensuring that only compatible gems
are installed as appropriate. Bundler::Multilock does not yet handle this,
and requires the Ruby version to match among all lockfiles.

### Upgrading from Bootboot to Bundler::Multilock

First, remove Bootboot's plugin bootstrapping from your Gemfile, then install
Bundler::Multilock as above. Alter your Gemfile as appropriate, similar to this:

```ruby
# original Gemfile

if ENV['DEPENDENCIES_NEXT']
  gem "rails", "~> 5.2.0"
else
  gem "rails", "~> 5.1.0"
end
```

```ruby
# updated Gemfile

lockfile "Gemfile_next.lock" do
  gem "rails", "~> 5.2.0"
end

lockfile do
  gem "rails", "~> 5.1.0"
end
```

Be sure to update any tooling that uses `DEPENDENCIES_NEXT` to use `BUNDLE_LOCKFILE`
(with the appropriate changes to its value).
